## Capstone basics
### Case study and Portfolio
#### Case study
**Case study**: A common way for employers to assess job skills and gain insight into how you approach common data related challenges.
For example, you might be asked to clean and analyze a data set, offer a proposal around how to measure the success of a project, or figure out and define metrics of success for a specific product.
Usually, there's a time limit for the case study you've been asked to do. But the good news is, your answer to the case study doesn't have to be perfect.
Show off your thought process so that the interviewers can understand how you approach the problem

#### Portfolio
**Portfolio**: Collection of case studies that can be shared with potential employers.
Portfolios can be stored on public websites like GitHub, Kaggle, or Tableau, or on your blog.
Your portfolio can also be linked in your resume.

> "In any occupation, across the globe, across various industries, having a knack and understanding of data is going to be crucial for everyone."
> "There's a misconception or a myth that when you're applying for a job, you should know all the right answers. You should answer every question that they ask correctly. But that's false. What every interviewer is looking for is how you think, what's your thought process, what is your way of looking at a certain problem, and how do you approach solving those problems."
> "One of the fascinating things about being a data analyst is you are a storyteller. You look at the data and every data point out there has a story to tell."

#### Tips with an example
> **Example**
> *"How would you rate Data Partners Real Estate's resale performance in 2020, what's driving these trends, and what would your action plan be?"*
> The company gave job applicants a market dataset including things like active listings, visits, resell contracts, price points, and geocodes.

**Case study tips:**
- First, make sure your case study answers the question being asked.
Slide 2 lays out the question. It identified poor performance in a specific housing price band;
Including a quick overview of their findings here helps keep the case study focused on the task at hand.
- Make sure that you're communicating the steps you've taken and the assumptions you've made
It will show your thought process and problem-solving skills.
In page 2, we've got an explanation of the metrics they use to perform the analysis.
And in each slide after this, they use the title to tell their story and explain the steps of their analysis.

**Portfolios tips:**
- The best portfolios are personal, unique, and simple.
- Make sure that your portfolio is relevant and presentable


It's good to add things to your portfolio that you care about, things that are interesting to you and stuff you'd love to share.

The best portfolios are personal, unique, and simple. Your portfolio’s a chance to show people who you are and what you’re interested in. You want to keep your portfolio pretty simple, and focus on your skills as a data analyst.

### Portfolio and Case study checklist
It is important to understand the key components of both a portfolio and case study, as both are essential to success when applying for jobs.

#### What to include in your portfolio
-   **Biography**: The main focus of your portfolio is to introduce yourself in a strong and memorable way. Write a concise and clear introduction of yourself. The goal is to capture your audience’s interest and compel them to want to meet you to learn more. 
-   **Contact page**: Be sure to include a way for others to get in touch with you, whether it be via email, phone call (if you are comfortable), or social media handles (especially LinkedIn). You might find that your website has its own built-in contact form if you use common website builders. 
-   **Resume**: In previous readings, [Adding Professional Skills to your Resume](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/supplement/8FBgn/adding-professional-skills-to-your-resume "Adding Professional Skills to your Resume") and [Adding Soft Skills to your Resume](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/supplement/U8xZj/adding-softs-skills-to-your-resume "Adding Soft Skills to your Resume"), you learned how to craft a resume that reflects your skills and your experience. Be sure to include a resume somewhere in your portfolio.
-   **Accomplishments**: You are not just limited to your past experiences. Any present career-worthy highlights you can think of should be included. This can be any certifications you have earned, data analytics events you have attended, or even blog posts you have published.
-   **An image of you (optional)**: Add a personal touch with your photo. All you need is a simple, clear photo that represents you well.

#### What to include in a case study
A great case study will include the following:
-   **Introduction**: Make sure to state the purpose of the case study. This includes what the scenario is and an explanation on how it relates to a real-world obstacle. Feel free to note any assumptions or theories you might have depending on the information provided. 
-   **Problems**: You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings.
-   **Solutions**: Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution.
-   **Conclusion**: End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this.
-   **Next steps**: Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.



### Real-world portfolio hosts
A portfolio contains samples that you share with potential employers. Case studies are practice or example data analytics projects that you can create for your portfolio.
After you have created your online portfolio, you can add a link to it on your resume.

Now, let’s review three platforms you can use to host your portfolio.

#### Personal websites
Creating a **personal website** to host your portfolio is a great option because you can also use it to showcase aspects of your personality or background that contribute to your professional brand.

For example, this visualization from data analyst [Bill Yost’s website](https://www.billyost.net/ "This link takes you to Bill Yost's personal website.") demonstrates his ability to create a Tableau visualization but also tells a very personal story about his battle with cancer.

#### GitHub
**GitHub** is a hosted platform primarily used by developers as a repository for code, but it can also be used as a repository for documentation.

For inspiration, check out this [R usage tips](https://github.com/erikaduan/R-tips/blob/master/README.md "This link takes you to a document example posted by a GitHub user.") readme document a GitHub user posted.

#### Kaggle
If you have an account on **Kaggle**, you can also use it as a platform to host your portfolio and personal background. 

Check out these profile examples:
-   [Jesse Mostipak's profile](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak "This link takes you to Jesse Mostipak's profile on Kaggle.")
-   [Meg Risdal's profile](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal "This link takes you to Meg Risdal's profile on Kaggle.")

You can use Kaggle to create your own **Jupyter Notebook** for potential employers to view.
-   Click [Jesse Mostipak's Notebooks link](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/notebooks "This link takes you to the Notebooks Summary in Jesse Mostipak's profile on Kaggle.") to view her notebooks

-   Click [Meg Risdal's Notebooks link](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/notebooks "This link takes you to the Notebooks Summary in Meg Risdal's profile on Kaggle.") to view her notebooks





### Revisiting career paths in data
![](attachments/q8GaAZFfTRuBmgGRX50b7g_dd328f618cd64e0e9687005697edff9f_Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-11.45.12-PM.png)
The skills you gain with the Google Data Analytics Certificate align with skills that data analyst jobs require.
Many career counselors recommend that you customize your resume each time you apply for a job so that your experience and skills align as closely as possible with the requirements listed in the job description.

For each of the relevant skills in the previous table, consider the following: 
-   Possible phrases from job descriptions
-   Examples of matching skills from this certificate

Let’s go through the skills for data analysts and examine common phrases you might find in job descriptions:

**Skill: database queries**

| Job description phrase                                       | Skills from this program you could include in your resume    |

**Skill: programming**

This is an area where you can potentially distinguish yourself from other candidates when you apply for a data analyst position. Programming is considered a more advanced or higher-level skill and might not even be in a job description for a junior data analyst role. You learned to use R for data analysis as part of this program, and adding programming skills to your resume might make your application stand out.

| **Job description phrase**                                   | **Skills from this program you could include in your resume** |

**Aiming for more technical roles**
If your goal is to work in a more technical role like a data scientist, the Google Data Analytics Certificate is a good starting point. But you might need to pursue additional learning opportunities to advance your skills, such as:

- Completing other professional certificates (Coursera offers many)
- Registering for college courses as a part-time or full-time student and applying for paid internships 
- Continuing your education in a four-year college degree program like computer science, data science, or management information systems
